I recently finished "Dawnshard" by Brandon Sanderson. It was... fine. I don't think it's a bad book. I think I probably just have Sanderson fatigue after reading Stormlight book 5. Dawnshard is basically Stormlight 3.5 . For some reason I missed this book so I'm reading it out of order, which might be part of why I'm not so excited by it. Perhaps I would have been more excited about it, if I read it 4 or 5 years ago.

Now that we got that out of the way, let's move on to what I really wanted to talk about in this post: my takeaways from this book. 

> **NOTE**: This post doesn't assume you know or care about any of these books or characters. (While I'd love it if you read these books as well, you might feel you have something better to do with your life than catch up on 5 or 6 thousand pages.) Because this post is about book 3.5 in a series, **there will be some light spoilers** of earlier books. 

## My Takeaways
Rysn is a type of character that we don't see very often lately. *A strong female character?* Uh, no. We see a billion of those lately. *A paraplegic?* Well, uh yeah actually she is a paraplegic and we don't see many paraplegic characters lately, or ever. But that wasn't the thing that stood out to me. 

You see, I've followed Rysn's character for just about a decade. I remember her before she was a paraplegic. No doubt, she is one now, and it is a very big part of her journey, but I don't think it's the biggest thing that stands out to me, at the moment. What stands out to me at the moment? Rysn is a kind of character that is so rarely seen lately. 

**Rysn is an unashamed capitalist.**
