At the start of this year I decided to do a very cliché[^1] thing, I made a new year's resolution to start getting fit. When I started my membership, they asked me a ton of questions about my fitness goals. My goals were pretty simple. I didn't care about my weight, or any lifting goal. I just knew that I was incredibly out of shape and any physical activity had to be an improvement. I essentially had two goals: 

1. Build a habit of going to the gym at least twice a week. 
2. Get to the point where I feel comfortable in the gym. 

[^1]: Clichés are not so bad, that's when all the new gym membership sales are.

I was more interested in longevity than anything else. I don't want to start something that I will just drop later. I want to start a habit that I will keep doing for life. And I want to get to the point where I actually enjoy working out and I look forward to it. And I can say now, halfway through the year, that I have met that goal. I'm not ripped, but I can see positive change in my body. I don't get tired as easily and my strength is improving. But it's been quite a journey to get here. 

## Nearly Passing Out At The Gym
My first foray back into fitness this year was terrible. I took my wife to 24 Hour Fitness for a free 3-day pass. They gave us a short tour of the gym and then we were off to the races. I didn't do anything that crazy. I swam a few laps in the pool. My wife and I tried the sauna for the first time. (It felt horrible, we thought our lungs were on fire.) Then I lifted a few light weights. Nothing was that strenuous, but for some reason, things really started to change. My balance got shaky, my head felt woozy, I had shortness of breath. I felt absolutely awful, and I had to lie down on the ground. _What the heck was happening? Was I about to pass out?_

The staff at the gym were gracious and gave me a protein bar which really did help. I was very discouraged, but I decided to keep trying. 

## Getting Hoodwinked into a Trainer Subscription
I knew that I needed a physical trainer. Just stepping foot inside a gym made me feel like an awkward fish out of water. I felt like I could see people all around me staring at me and judging me. I also felt like a complete moron. I've never been athletic, and I had been in a gym less than a handful of times in my whole life. Give me a computer and I'm right at home, but give me some dumbbells and I look like a fish out of water. 

Well I got a gym membership and winced at the yearly membership price. Then I got their free consultation (which turned out to just be a sales pitch for a personal trainer) and I winced even more at that price tag. But I decided as much as I didn't like the price, I should get the trainer. The trainer would be able to correct my technique which would help me avoid injuries. Plus the trainer would provide expertise which would help me to know a little more and feel less out of place. Well turns out there was a bigger reason for me to get the trainer. Cash. Trainers are expensive, and ironically, that was actually a positive thing for me. I struggled to find motivation to come to the gym, but the trainer made it quite motivating. If I missed a session, I wasn't getting a refund. 

## The Gym Abruptly Went Out Of Business
My first[^@] trainer, Billy was great. He was a ripped cross-fit trainer. I couldn't help but feel inadequate and weak but he really met me where I was. He wasn't interested in judging me. He just wanted to help me meet my goals. I've discovered that I really value trainers and they are some special people. 

[^@]: _First trainer? You had more than one?_ Yup that was some foreshadowing. 

Still, I didn't really want to spend the money for sessions twice a week. The sticker shock was too high. So my plan was to meet with my trainer once a week, and then train on my own once a week. Yeah, that didn't really happen. On my own, my insecurities would flare up, and soon I just didn't really show up between sessions with my trainer. It also turns out that going to the gym only once a week isn't such a great idea. It's just rare enough that any benefit that you got from that week is probably lost by the next week. 

Still, I was slowly getting more confident and less self-conscious. But I had no idea what a wild ride was coming. Out of nowhere, I got a text from my trainer. My gym was going out of business and there were closing at the very end of that same day! Apparently they hadn't been meeting their tax obligations and the city was shutting them down immediately. Without any say in the matter, they moved my trainer and I to another gym on the other side of town!

The other gym wasn't so bad. Sure it was in a less convenient location, but it had way more machines. Then again it was also far more crowded. Tradeoffs. At this gym, Billy started pushing me more and more and I was growing. He started running me through circuit training and it was very tough. But it's supposed to be tough, right? No pain, no gain. Well, maybe it was a little too tough, because here I was on the floor again, almost about to pass out. My trainer was very supportive, and suggested that I probably wasn't eating enough calories to support my increased physical activity. He suggested that I get more protein. 

## My Trainer Went Back To Prison
In the early summer, I went on a family trip and took a few weeks off. I've discovered that life throws many curveballs which can really make it hard to build and keep new habits. Travelling is certainly such a curveball. I texted my trainer to let him know when I'd be back from my trip and... my trainer didn't respond. That was unlike him. Two weeks later, he still didn't respond. Now that was really unlike him. Then I got a text from someone else. Apparently my trainer was an ex-convict. He was just about to sign the papers at his halfway house and he was ready to finish the last of his sentence except... Apparently the state miscalculated his sentence and he still had time left to serve, so they locked him up again. 

My gym went out of business, I keep passing out at the gym, and now my trainer is in prison. How many more curveballs am I gonna get? More. Definitely more. 

At this point, I was tired of it all. I didn't sign up for this. I literally signed up for a different gym, and now I didn't even have a trainer anymore. I asked the gym to end my trainer subscription early. I though given the unprecedented circumstances, the gym would cut me some slack. They did not.
