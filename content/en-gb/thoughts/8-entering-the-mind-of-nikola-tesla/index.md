I recently had the pleasure of reading and finishing the book "My Inventions" by Nikola Tesla. This book is a collection of articles written by Tesla himself, where he shares his thoughts and experiences on various topics related to science, technology, and his inventions. The book is not comprehensive enough to feel like a true autobiography, but it does provide a glimpse into the mind of one of the greatest inventors of all time.

While reading this book, I was surprised to see how important Tesla's Christian faith and upbringing were to him. Tesla's father, who was a clergyman, and particularly his mother, played a significant role in shaping his worldview and approach to science. He believed that there was a divine order to the universe and that science and religion were not mutually exclusive. This perspective is refreshing, especially in today's world, where many people view science and religion as irreconcilable.

This book was a short yet insightful read, and I highly recommend it to anyone even if you are not particularly interested in Tesla or his inventions. It is a fascinating glimpse into the mind of a brilliant inventor and thinker, and it provides valuable insights into the relationship between science, religion, and the human experience. Tesla's reflections on his life and work are thought-provoking and inspiring, and they remind us of the importance of curiosity, creativity, and perseverance in the pursuit of knowledge and understanding.

## Why I Read This Book
I think it's worth asking yourself the question before, during and after reading a book: *Why should I read this book?* In one sense, I think that every single book is worth reading. Avoiding any book does not promote learning, curiosity or growth as a person. But alas, there's a finite amount of time and an endless mountain of books, and let's face it, some books are more worthwhile than others. 

So why would I read this book? Is it because I relate to Tesla? Definitely not. Tesla is a very strange, unique individual. I will never think in the same way as him, and chances are, I won't even meet someone who thinks like him. But I still think it's important and valuable to read about people who think differently than you. I hardly care about minute dates and facts in biography. These tend to reveal trivial insights. I think it's much more valuable to understand the way that other people think. It challenges my own thinking and helps me to understand the world in a different way. Perhaps there are ways where my own thinking is flawed or limited. Or perhaps understanding the way that other people can help me to understand others around me better.

In any case, it is a fascinating privilege to be able to read the thoughts of another person, especially one so unique and impactful as Tesla. We should not take this privilege for granted. I think that, on average, it holds far more value than that new show that just came out on Netflix.
