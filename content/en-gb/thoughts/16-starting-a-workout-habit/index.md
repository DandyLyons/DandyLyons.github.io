At the start of this year I decided to do a very cliché[^1] thing, I made a new year's resolution to start getting fit. When I started my membership, they asked me a ton of questions about my fitness goals. My goals were pretty simple. I didn't care about my weight, or any lifting goal. I just knew that I was incredibly out of shape and any physical activity had to be an improvement. I essentially had two goals: 

1. Build a habit of going to the gym at least twice a week. 
2. Get to the point where I feel comfortable in the gym. 

[^1]: Clichés are not so bad, that's when all the new gym membership sales are.

I was more interested in longevity than anything else. I don't want to start something that I will just drop later. I want to start a habit that I will keep doing for life. And I want to get to the point where I actually enjoy working out and I look forward to it. And I can say now, halfway through the year, that I have met that goal. I'm not ripped, but I can see positive change in my body. I don't get tired as easily and my strength is improving. But it's been quite a journey to get here. 

## Nearly Passing Out At The Gym
My first foray back into fitness this year was terrible. I took my wife to 24 Hour Fitness for a free 3-day pass. They gave us a short tour of the gym and then we were off to the races. I didn't do anything that crazy. I swam a few laps in the pool. My wife and I tried the sauna for the first time. (It felt horrible, we thought our lungs were on fire.) Then I lifted a few light weights. Nothing was that strenuous, but for some reason, things really started to change. My balance got shaky, my head felt woozy, I had shortness of breath. I felt absolutely awful, and I had to lie down on the ground. _What the heck was happening? Was this a _

The staff at the gym were gracious and gave me a protein bar which really did help. 

## Getting Hoodwinked into a Trainer Subscription
I knew that I needed a physical trainer. Just stepping foot inside a gym made me feel like an awkward fish out of water. I felt like I could see people all around me staring at me and judging me.
