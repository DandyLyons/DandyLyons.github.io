Another day, another cancel culture campaign. Who is the target this time? On X, Elon Musk told his followers to ["cancel Netflix for the health of your kids"](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1973292474375479556). Well sure you can choose to follow that or not, but there's plenty of other reasons to cancel Netflix already. How about the mountains of cash you'll be saving over time? How about the even bigger mountain of time you'll be saving? How about the ever increasing monthly fees? Maybe it's not so great to buy from the company that literally invented binge-watching. While you're at it, why don't you cancel Hulu, Disney+, HBO Max, and all them other money-suckers? 

If you feel like maybe you wanna cut the cord... er subscription, then here's a quick little guide for you. 

## Find Your Favorite Shows On Blu-Ray
The trajectory for these cancel campaigns is usually the same. A bunch of people cancel, but then dang, my favorite show came out with a new season and I can only watch it on Netflix. Wrong. You can watch it elsewhere, even Netflix exclusives. Where? On Blu-Ray and DVD. Most of Netflix's biggest shows are also released on Blu-Ray. Better yet, **you can borrow many of these for free from your local library**. If you absolutely must watch that show (which you don't), then you can still watch it without a subscription. 

## Embrace JOMO
It's fun to be a part of a cultural moment. It's fun to react to a hit new show when all your friends and family are reacting to the same thing. And FOMO says it's not too fun to miss out on things. Well, that's only half of the equation. Sure, you're missing out on supposedly good things[^!], but the truth is you're also missing out on so many junk things. Like petty drama, and fear mongering, and manipulative product placement ads. 

[^!]: many of which are fleeting and in the long run provide little, if any, value at all

## Tons Of Other Options
But there are some of you who are still saying, _I don't want to live under a rock._ Alright, fine. Here's a bunch of other streaming services that are actually free: 

*   **[Tubi](https://tubitv.com/)**: Massive on-demand library (over 250,000 titles in the U.S.), including movies, TV, and more than 250 live channels. Owned by Fox, it carries films from major studios and unique Tubi Originals. No sign-up required but registration gives parental controls and watchlists.
*   **[Pluto TV](https://pluto.tv/)**: Closest competitor to Tubi, with hundreds of live “channels” simulating cable TV plus on-demand classic shows and movies. Very ad-heavy but broad in both topics and nostalgia.
*   **[The Roku Channel](https://therokuchannel.roku.com/)**: Pre-installed on Roku devices but available anywhere. Offers on-demand movies, TV, over 500 live channels, and Roku Originals. Especially convenient for Roku hardware users but works across platforms.
*   **[Sling Freestream](https://www.sling.com/freestream)**: Free tier of Sling, offering 600+ live channels, on-demand content, parental controls, and even free DVR (10 hours)—a rare feature among free streamers. Can be a base for paid Sling add-ons.
*   **[Plex](https://www.plex.tv/)**: Known for its media server tools, Plex also offers a substantial library of free, ad-supported streaming movies and TV and some live programming.
*   **[Xumo Play](https://play.xumo.com/)**: “FAST” service with both on-demand content and dozens of linear channels, including news and entertainment. Similar to Pluto, suitable for casual flipping.

But there's a teeny tiny little catch. Ads. Please forgive me. These streaming services have ads, just like old school TV. How terrible! Except wait a minute, Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and basically all the other streaming services [still show ads even when you are paying for their service](https://www.emarketer.com/content/streaming-growth-now-driven-by-ad-tiers--not-ad-free-plans). 

Well heck, why the heck would I pay money to force myself to watch ads? If I'm gonna be forced to watch ads anyways, then I might as well watch them for free. And if you must have both free and ad-free then these are great options:

*   **[Kanopy](https://www.kanopy.com/)**: Uniquely accessible via a public library card or student ID, Kanopy specializes in academic content, independent films, classics, and documentaries—no ads, but library affiliation required.
*   **[Hoopla](https://www.hoopladigital.com/)**: Like Kanopy, requires a library card, offering access to films, TV, audiobooks, comics, and music—great for educational and family selections.

Besides, maybe ads aren't all that bad. Ads remind you to go to the bathroom, to take a break from your binge watching habit, and to maybe go outside. 

## Go Touch Grass
Our ancestors somehow lived for countless generations without streaming services. How in the world did they survive without a steady stream of The Great British Baking Show? It must have been hell. 

Probably not. Who said you need Netflix to chill? Our folks have been chilling just fine without Netflix. It's about time we rediscover fun. 

- **Tabletop games:** Tabletop games are a much better form of entertainment than Netflix or even video games. They allow you to actually interact with friends and build lasting memories. 
- **Finish that novel you said you were gonna write:** Writing is such a great activity. It sharpens your mind and refines your thinking. And when you're done, you're left with something you can look back on and be proud of. When have you ever been proud of a Netflix binge? 
- **Go do cool stuff:** Don't you find it strange how we live vicariously through our entertainment? We love to watch content of people doing incredible things like win a chess tournament or run a crazy tiger zoo. Well, why don't you go out and do some of that cool stuff yourself? It requires more time, hard work and effort but in the long run it is far more entertaining. Plus it provides something Netflix has never been able to supply, fulfillment. 
Here are 3 more items to add to your list:
-   **Learn a new skill:** Whether it's playing a musical instrument, coding, or learning a new language, acquiring a new skill offers a sense of accomplishment and expands your horizons. YouTube offers a goldmine of free educational content. (YouTube is also a blackhole for doomscrolling.) There are tons of sites like [Skillshare](https://www.skillshare.com/en/) that offer courses. 
-   **Explore the outdoors:** Disconnect from screens and reconnect with nature. Go for a hike, try camping, or simply spend time in a local park. The fresh air, natural beauty, and physical activity are invigorating, reducing stress and boosting your mood in ways that no amount of indoor entertainment ever could.

Alright, now hopefully, your streaming cancellation plan can last a little longer.
