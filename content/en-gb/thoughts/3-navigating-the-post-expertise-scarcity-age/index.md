Hey everyone, following up on my last post, "Post Expertise Scarcity."

In that post, we talked about how the internet fundamentally changed the value of **information**. It used to be that knowing things others didn't (like a doctor's medical knowledge locked in textbooks and schools) was incredibly valuable simply because that information was scarce and hard to access. But the internet and tools like Google made information super abundant – instant access to almost anything became the norm.

The conclusion we drew, following ideas like those in Cal Newport's *Deep Work*, was that in this "post-information scarcity" age, the real value shifted from just *knowing* information to having **expertise** – the deep understanding, skill, and mastery needed to actually *do* something with all that abundant information. Simply Googling answers wasn't enough to replace a doctor, for example.

But here's the twist, and where things are changing *again*.

### Welcome to Post-Expertise Scarcity

Something new is happening that's impacting expertise itself. Think about the powerful AI tools available today – ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and so many others. You can now ask deep, complex questions on almost any topic and get detailed, often insightful answers, sometimes even with references, in mere minutes or seconds.

Now, I know what you might be thinking: these tools aren't perfect! And you're absolutely right, they mess up sometimes, even hilariously. But honestly, that doesn't change the fundamental shift that's happening, and here's why:

1.  **Rapid Improvement:** They are getting dramatically better at an incredible pace.
2.  **Speed and Availability:** They answer *far* faster than any human expert ever could, and they're available 24/7. Even an imperfect answer quickly can still move you forward faster than waiting for a human.
3.  **Scale:** They can process and synthesize information on a scale a human simply can't.

What does this mean? It means that access to expert-level *output* or *opinion* is becoming significantly less scarce. It's no longer locked away behind years of schooling, expensive consultations, or hard-to-find individuals. You can get a detailed explanation of a complex scientific concept or even functional code with just a few prompts.

This doesn't mean human experts are instantly useless – far from it! But it *does* mean that simply *being* an expert in a specific domain, where your value was primarily in having access to and command of scarce knowledge, is changing. **We are entering an age of post-expertise scarcity.**

The question then becomes: If information became abundant, and then expertise became the scarce, valuable thing... what becomes truly valuable when expertise itself is becoming less scarce? That's the cliffhanger we left off on, and what we need to think about now.

### Adapting to Abundance: Lessons from the Past

Industries have faced this challenge before. When digital information made music copying trivial (bye-bye record sales!), the music industry didn't vanish. They found new things to sell that were still scarce: live experiences (tours), unique items (merch), access (streaming subscriptions), and rights (publishing). They created new models and artificial scarcity (like selling a *license* to use software, not the software itself).

So, what might be genuinely scarce and valuable in a world where asking an AI for expert output is easy?

Consider the world of open-source software. The code is free – infinitely copyable, zero scarcity. Yet, massive companies thrive built *on* open source. They sell things that *are* scarce: **time, effort, support, and specialized implementation.**

But as AI gets better, even some of those might become less scarce. What else is left? I'm still figuring this out, but here are a few thoughts on where enduring value might lie:

1.  **True Innovation:** AI excels at remixing and combining existing ideas. But generating something genuinely, conceptually *new* – a novel framework, a truly original artistic vision, a breakthrough scientific hypothesis that isn't just a synthesis of known data – still seems to be a frontier where human creativity holds unique power.
2.  **Recognizing and Valuing Good Ideas:** With an abundance of AI-generated ideas (or even human ones), the skill shifts to discerning which ideas are truly good, viable, and worth pursuing. It's about judgment, intuition, and strategic thinking – knowing *what* to build or *what* information matters most.
3.  **Discerning "Bullshit" and Exercising Critical Thinking:** This is more important than ever. As AI can generate convincing text, images, or code with ease, the ability to critically evaluate information, spot inaccuracies, understand limitations, and think independently becomes a superpower. We need to avoid letting AI read and think *for* us entirely, or we risk losing these vital skills.

In short, as information became abundant, value shifted to expertise. Now, as expertise output becomes more accessible, the value seems poised to shift again – towards uniquely human cognitive abilities like novel creation, wise judgment, and robust critical thinking.

The game keeps changing, and the skills that matter most are shifting with it.
