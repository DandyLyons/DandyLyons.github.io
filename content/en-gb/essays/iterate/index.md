## **I: I don't know what the heck I'm doing.**

Do you feel inadequate? Great. You’re in good company. Inadequacy is normal. We are all inadequate in some way (but only some of us are brave enough to admit it). How are you going to improve if you don’t even realize that you need to improve? Embracing this initial feeling is the first step toward genuine growth.

## **T: That's okay.**

Take it easy on yourself. It is okay to not be okay. This doesn't mean we settle for mediocrity; rather, it means we grant ourselves permission to be human. We simply need to let go of the relentless pursuit of perfectionism and acknowledge where we are right now.

## **E: Everyone is a work in progress.**

When you have the courage to admit that you are not perfect, you finally start to realize that *everyone* is a work in progress. Sure, you already knew that nobody is perfect, but did you truly believe it? Didn’t it often feel like everyone had their shit together except for you? When you start looking closer, you begin to see: nobody has it completely figured out. We’re all just trying to keep it together, learning and growing along the way.

## **R: Reflect on your past wins and losses.**

Be balanced in your reflection. Don’t focus solely on your wins, lest you become complacent and miss opportunities for deeper growth and improvement. But also, don’t dwell only on your losses, lest you discourage yourself and destroy all hope. Learn from both, celebrating successes while extracting wisdom from setbacks.

## **A: Aim for Progress, Not Perfection**

Quit aiming for perfect; it is an unattainable and often paralyzing target. Instead, aim for better. Focus on taking the next small step forward. It doesn’t have to be **dramatically** better every time. Most of the time, it won’t be, and that's perfectly fine. Consistent small improvements compound over time.

## **T: Tiny Improvements Add Up**

The journey of a thousand miles truly begins with a single step. Don't underestimate the power of consistently making small, almost imperceptible improvements. These minor adjustments, done regularly, are the building blocks of significant change.

## **E: Eventually You Will See the Difference**

In the moment, it can feel hopeless. You put in all this work and don’t see any immediate results. But trust the process. In the long run, the cumulative effect of your consistent efforts will yield improvements—sometimes even **dramatic** improvements that might surprise you. Keep iterating, keep growing, and the difference will become undeniable.

>Not that I have already obtained all this, or have already arrived at my goal, but I press on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold of me. Brothers and sisters, I do not consider myself yet to have taken hold of it. But one thing I do: Forgetting what is behind and straining toward what is ahead, I press on toward the goal to win the prize for which God has called me heavenward in Christ Jesus.
> — Philippians 3:12-14 (NIV)
