The Marxist looks at another who has what he envies  
and says "What an injustice!  
We workers of the world must unite.  
We must seize the means of production  
and distribute  
from each according to his ability  
and to each according to his needs.  
And all will be right in the world  
when the party rules  
and everyone's income is equal, (especially the party leaders)."

The Capitalist looks at another who has what he envies  
and says "What an injustice!  
We innovators of the world must compete.  
We must acquire the means of profit  
and capture  
from each according to his exploitable value  
and to each according to his discretionary income.  
And all will be right in the world  
when the rule is to party  
and everyone's belly is full, (especially the shareholders)."

The Jealous looks at Marxism and Capitalism and says to himself  
"Either gun will do."
