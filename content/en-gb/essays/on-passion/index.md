**What is your passion?** What is your _joie de vivre_?[^!] What makes you feel truly alive? Why do you wake up in the morning? What's your reason for being? 

[^!]: [joie de vivre](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/joie_de_vivre) is a French phrase meaning "joy of living".

So often, we've been told to "follow our passion" or "do what we love". But **what the heck is passion, anyway?** Is it a feeling? A state of mind? A specific activity? Passion feels like such a vague concept. How are we supposed to find our passion when we don't even know what a passion is? 

## How We Use the Word "Passion" Today

Today, we look up to "passionate" people. These are people who deeply care about something. They are driven to work for a cause, to create art, to build a business, or to help others. 

## The Etymology of "Passion"
The word "passion" comes from the Latin *passio*, which means "suffering" or "enduring". It is related to the verb *patior*, which means "to suffer" or "to endure".

## The History of "Passion"
If you read the puritans, you'll find yet another meaning of the word "passion". Often, they used "passion" to refer to our intense emotional desires, which are often sinful. 

## The Passion of Jesus
How in the world are these meanings connected? It feels so random and unrelated. But alas, each of these ideas are deeply and profoundly connected through the Passion of Jesus Christ.


## Jesus Redeemed Passion
It's important that we do not forget just how radically horrible crucifixion was. 

This type of passion is so strange, so alien, so utterly bizarre. It baffles the mind. It breaks our categories. It borders on offensive. We can't help but ask ourselves, "How could a good and loving God do something so cruel and barbaric to His own Son?"

But really, we should be asking ourselves, "How could a Man willingly put Himself through such agony and torment?" There can only be one answer: 

>"But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us."
>(Romans 5:8)
