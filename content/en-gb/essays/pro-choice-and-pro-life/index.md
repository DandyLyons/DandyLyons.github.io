## There is nothing more anti-choice than taking away the life of another. 

## To celebrate the death of another human being is to let your soul rot. 

>Do not rejoice when your enemy falls, and let not your heart be glad when he stumbles, lest the LORD see it and be displeased, and turn away his.
>From Proverbs 24:17-18
