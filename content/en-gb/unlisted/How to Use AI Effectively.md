## Intro
The last few years have been a rollercoaster of AI advancements, filled with radical new breakthroughs, overhyped products that are straight-up broken, and everything in between. But how much of AI is actually useful? In this new series **"Actually Useful AI"** we'll be focusing on how to incorporate AI into your projects in a way that is actually useful, while steering clear of the pitfalls. 

This series is not meant for early adopters or those who want to be at the forefront of tech. This series is meant for those who want to focus on getting things done and are curious how AI could help them. 

## Let's Define AI
Before moving further, we need to get on the same page about what _AI_ means. Unfortunately, AI is a fairly vague term[^1] that has come to mean many different things at various periods in history. Not too long ago, we would have described the ghosts in Pac-Man as AI. But who would call that AI today? If you ask 10 people what AI means, you'll get 10 different answers. Even if you ask the same person over the span of several decades, you will likely get several answers. 

[^1]: To be clear, there are precise technical definitions of AI. But this series is aimed toward non-technical users. Also, historically these technical definitions have changed over time, and many contradict others. 

There are so many definitions of AI. How do we find what they have in common? Each generation tends to view the most advanced computing technology as _AI_. As newer more advanced tech is developed, then our old tech doesn't seem so intelligent anymore. So our definition of AI changes. The new tech is called AI, and the old tech is demoted to some other name like _program_ or _algorithm_. So whatever we call AI today is likely to be called something else in the future.

So for the purposes of this series, let's try to use a definition that is clear enough to communicate, but flexible enough to encompass the inevitable changes that are coming. 

_AI_, stands for _Artificial Intelligence_, of course. So we can clearly see that AI is: 
1. **artificial**: not natural, but created by humans
2. **intelligent**: it is "smart"

It's that second word _intelligent_ that is surprisingly difficult to define. What does it mean to be intelligent? What makes us call a certain person intelligent? This should help us understand what intelligence is. 

### What is Intelligence? 
We might say that a person is intelligent if they know a lot of facts. A computer database can memorize far more facts than a human ever could, but we wouldn't call it _intelligent_. 

We might say a person is intelligent if they can solve complex math problems. However, even a small 90s has more computing power than the computers that sent NASA astronauts to the moon, yet we wouldn't call it _intelligent_. 

I'm convinced that intelligence is not just one thing. Rather it is a suite of capabilities which includes thinking, planning, understanding and problem-solving. For now let's say that **AI is simply some sort of technology that is able to behave in a manner that is similar to human intelligence**. 

Under that very broad definition, there are many forms of AI. Some are more advanced than others. In the past two years, two breakthrough technologies have risen to prominence: 

1. Large-Language Models and 
2. Stable Diffusion Models

The vast majority of the new "AI" features in the last two years are innovations and applications of these two core technologies.Both of these technologies are possible thanks to a technique called _machine learning_. 

## What is Machine Learning?
_Machine Learning_ is another buzz word that you'll often hear. Unfortunately, it also has a somewhat vague definition. _Machine Learning_ is often used interchangably with _AI_ and many people debate about the definition of machine learning but the important thing is this: **Today, computers are able to approximate human learning, just like they are able to approximate human intelligence**. 

## What Are Large Language Models?

Imagine we were playing a game where I give you a sentence and you fill in the blank: 

>The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy ________.

What should go in this blank? Most of us would reflexively say that the answer is _dog_. Now, how could we design a computer program that could play this same game? 

One approach would be to somehow write all of the rules of the English language into a computer program. Then, the computer could search through a list of every word in the English dictionary. The first word that doesn't break any of those rules could then be used to fill in the blank. 

This strategy would "work", and it would make sentences that are grammatically correct, but it would still generate sentences that are strange, inhuman, and nonsensical. 

But the real problem with this strategy is that is not how we humans learn. Typically we start speaking in simple sentences as very young children **before** learning any grammar. So how do we do it? We practice and we gain experience. 

We can "program" computers to learn in a similar way to humans. We call this _machine learning_. To do this, we take a large amount of data (books, articles, Reddit posts, transcripts and tons of other things), and then we _train_ a model on this data. 

Training is extremely complicated, but the good news is **we don't need to understand exactly how it works if we want to you it**. Just like how you don't need to know everything about how your car works in order to drive it. However, **having at least a basic understanding of how something works can greatly improve your ability to use it**. For example, I don't need to understand how a spark plug works in my engine in order to drive it. But if I know just a little bit about cars then I know if I have an electric car, I don't have spark plugs so I don't need to replace them on my electric car. 

The goal of this series is to provide you with just enough knowledge about AI so that you are empowered to do the things that you want.
