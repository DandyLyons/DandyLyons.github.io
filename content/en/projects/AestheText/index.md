AestheText makes it easy to create _aesthetic_ text by mutating them into fun _fonts_ and _kaomoji_ facial characters. 

#### Fonts
There are dozens of fonts to choose from like 𝕥𝕙𝕚𝕤 or even ꓄ꀍꀤꌚ! These fonts are universal unicode symbols meaning they are compatible with practically any app or website. 
#### Kaomojis
Kaomojis are like emojis except they are made from multiple unicode characters, meaning there are literally infinite possible combinations. For exaple you could have a cute bear: ʕ·͡ᴥ·ʔ or even an angry man throwing a table: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
