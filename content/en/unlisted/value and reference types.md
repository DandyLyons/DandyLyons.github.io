# A Deep Dive into Value and Reference Types in Swift

## The Value vs. Reference Problem
- Analogy: Library bookshelf
  - **Value type**: the book you want to read
  - **Reference type**: The Shelf where the book is located.

## How Swift Handles This Problem

### What Value and Reference Types Mean

- **Takeaway**: 
  - **Value Types**: `struct`, `enum`, and tuples. 
  - **Reference Types**: `class`, `actor` and closures.  

### What Value and Reference Semantics Mean

- ‚≠ê: The distinction between value and reference **types** is a language-level feature (i.e. it's enforced by the compiler), but value and reference **semantics** is a language convention (i.e. not enforced by the compiler[^1]).
