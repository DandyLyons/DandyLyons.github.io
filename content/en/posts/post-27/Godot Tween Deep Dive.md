Godot Engine's Tween system is a powerful tool for creating animations and interpolations in your games. In this article, we'll take a deep dive into how the Tween system works and how you can use it to create complex animations and effects in your games.

## The Many "Animation" Systems in Godot
What is animation? In the early 1900s Walt Disney brought animation to a mainstream audience. By drawing a series of still images and playing them back in rapid succession, Disney was able to create the illusion of smooth change over time. This is the essence of animation: creating the illusion of smooth change. 

In game development, we are essentially doing the same process. The biggest difference however is that, typically, we are not drawing the frames ourselves. Instead, the game engine is responsible for rendering the frames for us. Instead, we are responsible for telling the game engine how to change the objects in our game.

The Godot game engine has several systems that allow you to create animations in your games. These include:
- The AnimationPlayer system
- The Tween system
- The Physics system

## How The Tween System Works
Any time you learn a new API, it's important to understand the life cycle of the system. In particular you should seek to answer the following questions: 
- What are the fundamental concepts that the API expects me to understand? 
- How do you create a new instance of the system?
  - Who is responsible for creating the instance?
- What are the various states that the system can be in?
  - How do you transition between these states?
- How do you destroy an instance of the system?
  - Who is responsible for destroying the instance?
